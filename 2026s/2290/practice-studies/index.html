                The buyer for an electronics store wants to estimate the proportion of defective wireless game controllers in a shipment of 5,000 controllers from the store’s primary supplier. The shipment consists of 200 boxes each containing 25 controllers. The buyer numbers the boxes from 1 to 200 and randomly selects six numbers in that range. She then opens the six boxes with the corresponding numbers, examines all 25 controllers in each of these boxes, and determines the proportion of the 150 controllers that are defective. What type of sample is this?

                Publishers of a magazine wish to determine what proportion of the magazine’s 50,000 subscribers are pleased with their subscription. The publishers intend to mail a survey to 1,000 subscribers randomly selected from those who have received the magazine for 5 years or more. This introduces selection bias, since long-subscribing customers are more likely to be pleased with their subscription. Which of the following would best eliminate selection bias?

                   We reduce selection bias by sending surveys to the <i>entire</i> population of interest. Here, this is the 50,000 subscribers, not just those individuals who subscribed for a certain duration of time. However, since mailed surveys require voluntary participation, the responses received by the publisher will still have bias.

                The director of a fitness center wants to examine the effects of two exercise classes (spinning and aerobics) on body fat percentage. A six-week spinning class and a six-week aerobics class are offered at the same time and on the same days, so that a person can enroll in only one of them. A new class of each is about to begin, and each class has 25 people in it. Ten people are randomly selected from each class. Each person’s body fat percentage is measured at the beginning and again at the end of the six-week class. Using the change in body fat percentage as the response variable and conducting a test at the $\alpha=0.01$ level, the director determines that there is a significant difference between the treatment means. Which of the following is a confounding variable in the study?

                    (A) is the explanatory variable and therefore cannot be the lurking or confounding variable.

                <p>
                    (C) is the lurking variable since the participants' choice of which class to take may be affected by who the instructor is, etc.

                    (E) are variables that are controlled for and therefore should not be lurking or confounding variable.
